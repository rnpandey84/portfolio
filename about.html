                <!-- Your 1000-2000 words content goes here -->
                <p>I’m a Computer Science undergraduate at South Asian University, currently pursuing a dual degree (BTech + MTech) with a strong focus on software development, problem-solving, and creative technologies. I have a deep interest in programming, with hands-on experience in C and Python, and a growing curiosity for full-stack development, algorithm design, and project-based learning.

Coming from a small town in Bihar, I’ve learned to approach challenges with resilience and self-discipline. While my academic journey has had its ups and downs, it has also sparked a strong desire to learn, improve, and build solutions that are both meaningful and efficient.<br>

Beyond academics <br> I’m actively exploring areas like freelancing, digital editing, and content creation. I’m also working toward building a solid foundation in computer science fundamentals, with a focus on data structures, logic building, and real-world application development. I aim to contribute to open-source projects and collaborate on innovative ideas that make a difference.<br><br>

This portfolio reflects not just my skills, but my mindset: growth-oriented, grounded, and ready to take on the evolving challenges of tech and beyond.

Let’s connect—whether it’s to collaborate, solve a problem, or create something impactful.
